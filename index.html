            <h3>Time:<br /></h3>
            PICCs PLUS has a standing policy to maintain an average of a 3-hour
            response time or less. Our 3-hour response time starts the time the
            pharmacy or facilities call the order in. Granted that there are
            situations that cause delays such as traffic, weather, or other
            unforeseeable circumstances, PICCs PLUS nurses will directly deal
            with the requiring facility to keep them informed and give them an
            approximate ETA.

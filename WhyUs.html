                more
                than

                removing existing venous access devices, replacing existing lines and even repairing/replacing lines
                that other companies placed. We also offer to provide in-services and education for your nurses. We

                or

                Our 3-hour response time starts the time the pharmacy or facilities call the order in. Granted that
                there are situations that cause delays such as traffic, weather, or other unforeseeable circumstances,
                PICCs PLUS nurses will directly deal with the requiring facility to keep them informed and give them
                an approximate ETA

                <strong>Patient Satisfaction:</strong> Studies show that patient’s number one fear is not of death,
                disease,
                or wrong
                prognosis, patient’s number one fear is the needle! PICCs PLUS nurses are highly trained in patient
